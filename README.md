# Brick-Breaker
A simple brick-breaker game based on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9qMm3JbOH0

A more Object-Orientated Approach was used in the architecture and gradle was implemented so that JUnit testing could be added dynamically. Error-handling has yet to be implemented.

**Instructions**
1. Begin game by hitting either the left or right arrow keys.
2. Use the same keys to move the green paddle left to right so that the ball does not drop off screen
3. Destroy bricks by hitting them with the ball
4. You win when all the bricks are gone!
